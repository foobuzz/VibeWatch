# VibeWatch

If like me you don't want to connect your Garmin to your phone to avoid data collection (allegedly anonymous), then this project is for you: Dashboards from raw data transferred from your watch to your computer via USB. Dashboards are implemented for sleep, stress, and BPM.

ðŸ¤– **Vibe Coding notice**

This is entirely vibe coded by Codex CLI (hence the name). And I did not review the code in any depth.

The commit history shows my prompts as commit messages, and code produced by the agent as the diff (with some minor/stupid back-and-forth not included); I started using this convention at like the 3rd or 4th commit.

I made Codex summarize the coding session in `session.md`, which I guess could be a context file to add if you ever intend to contribute with more vibe coding.


## Installation

- Prerequisites: Python 3.9+ and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- Clone this repository:
  - `git clone https://github.com/yourname/garmin-importer.git`
  - `cd garmin-importer`

## Usage

1. Create a folder `watch_data` in which you put backups of your watch's entire filesystem (should contain folders such as `Activity`, `Metrics`, `Monitor`, etc). You can simply plug the watch with USB to your computer to do this. The layout should resemble this:

```
- watch_data
  |- 2025-01-01
     |- Activity
     |- Metrics
     |- Monitor
     |- ... (other Garmin files)
  |- 2025-02-01
     |- ... (same)
```

You don't need to care about data overlap in the subsequent backups, because the script handles it for you. However, you should care about backuping often enough, because data retention might not be too big on your watch (for example, mine seems to have a 1-ish month retention for stress and BPM).

2. Create the data export for the dashboard:

```
uv run -- python garmin_gen.py --input ./smart_watch --out dist
```

3. Open the local site for seeing the dashboard:

```
uv run python -m http.server -d dist 8000
```

### Demo Data

Demo data used in the demo video is generated by

```
uv run garmin-demo --copy_index
```
